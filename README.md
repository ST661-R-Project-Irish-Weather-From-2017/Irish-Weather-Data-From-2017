This will likely have the following sections:

‚≠ï **Introduction**

‚úî What is the data about?

‚úî What questions will you look at? What methods will you use?

‚úî What information does the data contain? Cases, variables? How was it collected?

‚≠ï **Data Cleaning**

‚úî If there are multiple files how did you produce a single dataset?

‚úî Which subset of the data is relevant to your research question? Are you filtering out any observations from the analysis? Are you creating new variables?

‚úî Are there missing values?

‚úî Do variables have appropriate type?

‚úî Are there any strange aspects to the data?

‚≠ï **Analysis**

‚úî All graphs should have captions. Use fig.cap in the code chunk.

‚úî All graphs should have accompanying text explaining what is plotted and what insights are given by the graph. All graphs should have clearly labelled axes.

‚úî The same holds for tables

‚≠ï **Conclusions**

‚úî Give the answers posted to questions given in the introduction. What have we learned from this analysis?
